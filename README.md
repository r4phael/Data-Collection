# Machine Learning for Software refactoring
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/refactoring-ai/predicting-refactoring-ml.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/refactoring-ai/predicting-refactoring-ml)

This repository contains all our exploration on the use
of machine learning methods to recommend software refactoring.

It currently contains the following projects:

* `data-collection`: The java tool that collects refactoring and non-refactorings instances that are later used to train the ML algorithms. A docker script is available.

* `machine-learning`: The python scripts that train the different ML algorithms.

## Paper and appendix 

* The paper can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03338
* The raw dataset can be found here: https://zenodo.org/record/3547639
* The appendix with our full results can be found here: https://zenodo.org/record/3583980 


## The data collection tool

### Compiling the tool

Use Maven: `mvn clean compile`. Or just import it via IntelliJ; it will know what to do.

If you want to export a jar file and run it somewhere else, just do `mvn clean package`. A .jar file will be created under the `target/` folder. You can use this jar to run the tool manually.

To run the tests please run a local mariaDB database instance, for details see `src/main/test/java/integration/DataBaseInfor for details`.

### Running in a manual way

You can run the data collection by simply running the `RunSingleProject.java` class. This class contains a program that requires the following parameters, in this order:

1. _The dataset name_: A hard-coded string with the name of the dataset (e.g., "apache", "fdroid"). This information appears in the generated data later on, so that you can use it as a filter.

1. _The git URL_: The git url of the project to be analyzed. Your local machine must have all the permissions to clone it (i.e., _git clone url_ should work). Cloning will happen in a temporary directory.

1. _Storage path_: The directory where the tool is going to store the source code before and after the refactoring. This step is important if you plan to do later analysis on the refactored files. The directory structure basically contains the hash of the refactoring, as well as the file before and after. The name of the file also contains the refactoring it suffered, to facilitate parsing. For more details on the name of the file, see our implementation.

1. _Database URL_: JDBC URL that points to your MySQL. The database must exist and be empty. The tool will create the required tables.

1. _Database user_: Database user.

1. _Database password_: Database password. 

1. _Store full source code?_: True if you want to store the source code before and after in the storage path.

These parameters can be passed via command-line, if you exported a JAR file. 
Example:

```
java -jar refactoring.jar <dataset> <git-url> <output-path> <database-url> <database-user> <database-password> <k-threshold>
```

### Running via Docker

The data collection tool can be executed via Docker containers. It should be as easy as:

```
git clone https://github.com/mauricioaniche/predicting-refactoring-ml.git
cd predicting-refactoring-ml
sudo ./run-data-collection.sh projects-final.csv 4
```

Configurations can be done with the following **arguments**:
 1. [FILE_TO_IMPORT] - Csv file with all projects
 1. [Worker_Count] - Number of concurrent worker for the data collection, running the `RunQueue` class
 * **Optional**: 
     1. [DB_URL] - fully qualified url to a custom database, e.g. `jdbc:mysql://db:3306/refactoringdb`
     1. [DB_USER] - user name for the custom database
     1. [DB_PWD] - password for the custom database

* The default database is a containerized MySQL database (mariaDB), y can directly access it via localhost:3308, root, refactoringdb. You can change it in `docker-compose_db.yml->db` and `docker-compose.yml->worker->environment->REF_URL`, `REF_USER`, and `REF_PWD`.
* The default MySQL database, the RabbitMQ queue, and the source code are all stored in the `data-collection/volumes` folder. Feel free to change where the volumes are stored.
* The configurations of the workers (basically the same as defined in the manual execution) can be defined in `docker-compose.yml->worker->environment`.
* `http://localhost:15672` takes you to the RabbitMQ admin (user: guest, pwd:guest) and `localhost:8080` takes you to adminer, a simple DB interface.
Feel free to start as many workers as you want and/or your infrastructure enables you!

_Tip:_ If you are restarting everything, make sure to not import the projects again. Otherwise, you will have duplicated entries. Simply leave the file name blank in `import -> environment -> FILE_TO_IMPORT`.

### Cleaning up the final database

When running in scale, e.g., in thousands of projects, some projects might fail due to e.g., AST parser failure. Although the app tries to remove problematic rows, if the process dies completely (e.g., maybe out of memory in your machine), partially processed projects will be in the database. 

We use the following queries to remove half-baked projects completely from our database:

```
delete from RefactoringCommit where project_id in (select id from project where finishedDate is null);
delete from StableCommit where project_id in (select id from project where finishedDate is null);
delete from project where finishedDate is null;
```

## The machine learning pipeline

This project contains all the Python scripts that are responsible
for the ML pipeline.

### Installing and configuring the database.

First, install all the dependencies:

```
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
```

Then, create a `config.ini` file, following the example structure in
`config-example.ini`. In this file, you configure your database connection.

### Training and testing models

The main Python script that generates all the models and results is the
`main_generate_models.py`. You run it by simply calling `python3 main_generate_models.py`.

The script will follow the configurations in the `configs.py`. There, you can define which datasets to analyze, which models to build, which under sampling algorithms to use, and etc. Please, read the comments of this file.

For this script to run, you need to create a `results/` folder inside the
`machine-learning` folder. The results will be stored there.

The generated output is a text file with a weak structure. A quick way to get results is by grepping:

* `cat *.txt | grep "CSV"`: returns a CSV with all the models and their precision, recall, and accuracy.
* `cat *.txt | grep "TIME"`: returns a CSV with how much time it took to train and test the model.


Before running the pipeline, we suggest you to warm up the cache. The warming up basically executes all the required queries and cache them as CSV files. These queries can take a long time to run... and if you are like us, you will most likely re-execute your experiments many times! :) Thus, having them cached helps:

```
python3 warm_cache.py
```

If you need to clean up the cache, simply delete the `_cache` directory that is created under the `machine-learning` folder.


### Cross-domain validation

The `main_cross_models_evaluation.py` performs pairwise comparisons between
two different datasets. In other words, it tests all models that were trained using a given dataset A in the data of a given dataset B. For example, it tests how Apache models behave in F-Droid models.

For this script to run, you need to create a `results/` folder inside the
`machine-learning` folder. The final CSV will be stored there. The header of the
CSV is clear.


### Other scripts

The `main_parse_*` scripts help you in parsing the resulting text file, and extract the best hyper parameters, the feature importance, and the individual k-fold results. (These are always in maintenance, as they are highly sensitive to the format that the main tool generates logs.)
